# Going Mobile
##### Louise Chan's GitHub Page  
<br>
Hi, my name is Louise Chan, former Embedded Software Developer who's now pursuing an exciting new career in Mobile Applications Development. Why choose Mobile Development as a second career you say? It all started as a goal of mine to supplement my embedded software development skills with a little bit of knowledge in Android and iOS development so that I can create embedded device projects that will be able to interface with a mobile device. That "little bit" of knowledge ended up with **a lot of love** for mobile applications development so I decided to further explore this world of software development by studying Mobile Applications Development. So here I am today, a full-fledged mobile applications developer with a side front-end web development and an alter ego of an embedded software developer excited to face the challenges that awaits me in the world of mobile application development.

## Educational Background
<br>
I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering which is a 5-year academic program at the University of San Carlos in the Philippines and continued my studies here in Canada by taking up a post-graduate certificate program in Mobile Application Development and Strategy at George Brown College in Toronto.

## Skills
<br>
I have strong knowledge and understanding of native iOS and Android mobile application development supported with a solid understanding of the fundamentals and concepts of object-oriented programming. I'm also capable of writing hybrid applications using the React Native framework which is capable of running in an iOS, Android and web platform. During my studies at George Brown College, I also learned front-end web development which equipped me with the skills to develop web apps and pages using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and ReactJS.   

Other skills that I possess include knowledge in modelling and designing of relational databases using MySQL as well use of persistent storage data libraries and frameworks such the Room Database for the Android platform, Core Data for iOS platform and the Firebase cloud storage development platform. I am also knowledgeable in the use of RESTful APIs and were able to apply them in my mobile application designs as well as the different libraries and frameworks used in Android and iOS development such as Core Motion, Core Location, MapKit, Google Maps and Location services, Sensor Manager, AlamoFire, SwiftyJSON and so much more.

I won't bore you any further by listing more of my skills on this page but if your are interested in knowing more about my professional background, please feel free to take a look at my resume by clicking on the following link: <a href="./docs/LChan Mobile Developer Resume.pdf" target="_blank">[My Mobile Software Developer Resume]</a>
