Hi, my name is **Louise Chan**, a former Embedded Software Developer who's now pursuing an exciting new career in Mobile Applications Development. Why choose Mobile Development as a second career you say? It all started as a goal of mine to supplement my embedded software development skills with a little bit of knowledge in Android and iOS development so that I can create embedded device projects that will be able to interface with a mobile device. That "little bit" of knowledge ended up with me seeking to broaden my skills in mobile applications development so I decided to further explore this branch of software development by enrolling and studying in a Mobile Applications Development college program in Toronto. So here I am today, a full-fledged mobile applications developer with a side of front-end web development and an alter ego of an embedded software developer excited to face the challenges that awaits me in the world of mobile application development.

## Educational Background
<br>
I graduated with a **Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering** which is a 5-year academic program at the University of San Carlos in the Philippines and continued my studies here in Canada by taking up a post-graduate certificate program in **Mobile Application Development and Strategy at George Brown College in Toronto**.

## Skills
<br>
I have strong knowledge and understanding of **native iOS and Android mobile application development** supported with a **solid understanding of the fundamentals and concepts of object-oriented programming**. I'm also capable of writing **hybrid applications using the React Native framework** which is capable of running in an **iOS, Android and web platform**. During my studies at George Brown College, I also learned **front-end web development** which equipped me with the skills to develop web apps and pages using **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and ReactJS**.   

Other skills that I possess include knowledge in **modelling and designing of relational databases using MySQL** as well use of persistent storage data libraries and frameworks such as the **Room Database** for the Android platform, **Core Data** for iOS platform and the **Firebase cloud storage development platform**. I am also knowledgeable in the consumption of **REST APIs** and will be able to apply them in my mobile application designs as well as the different libraries and frameworks used in Android and iOS development such as **Core Motion, Core Location, MapKit, Google Maps and Location services, Sensor Manager, AlamoFire, SwiftyJSON** and so much more.

I won't bore you any further by listing more of my skills on this page but if your are interested in knowing more about my professional background, please feel free to take a look at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-chan-0525/" target="_blank">**my LinkedIn profile**</a> and send me a message if you would like to request for a copy of my Resume.
